<h3>Foreword</h3>

<p>Hello! Welcome to the site I built to show my story, The Symphony, with you! I just wanted to personally thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my story. That said, it should be made clear that this is not a happy story- I got the idea for it after hearing the news that my grandfather (who was in the service) had passed. It was cemented further after I marched in a Memorial Day Parade and got to watch a 21 gun salute in respect to our country&rsquo;s fallen few. I hope that you aren&rsquo;t turned away from the story by my foreword, I just wanted to ensure that you start it with the correct frame of mind to really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp; Tim Swenson</p>

<h2>The Symphony</h2>
<p>There is a low hum whispering through the air. It&rsquo;s a calming noise, soft and comforting. Natural. Without it, there would be nothing. But there is something, and it is good. Underneath it, a soft thud. The noise is soft, but unrelenting. The broken ticking of a heavy metronome, never ceasing.</p>
<p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>
<p>The noise gets softer and louder, as if it were a kite ebbing and flowing on the breeze. Nothing can stop the soft falling of this note. The drumbeat of time.</p>
<p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>
<p>Joining the soft thumping is a wobbly, shaking thing. Smothered, as if it were a child on its birthday. But there is no celebration here. Only a low hum, a soft thud, and a wavering tone.</p>
<p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>
<p>A steady drone starts to cut over the noise, but is soon lost. The monotone pace and delivery drag the tone to the same, soft, quiet place as the slow hum.</p>
<p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>
<p>The droning stops. A short pause, where nothing is heard except for the hum of the air. A short, angry voice cuts in. There is a soft whooshing sound, then the slam of wood on bone. Another fierce call. The shck-shck of steel on steel. One final command, then an abusive crash splits the air.</p>
<p>Crack. Crack. Crack.</p>
<p>After each crash, a soft tinkle is heard- a tiny metal rain. The wavering, crying sound returns as the echoes of the blasts fade. The droning voice goes on a little more. Then comes the sounds of a silent march, the shuffles of feet, the quite whimper. The soft, plodding thud continues. Then, it stops. All is quite for a moment as the footsteps fade. Then, a million cats start to purr, and fade as they go home. Nothing is left, except for the cold, slow hum of the air as it continues on its lonely path.</p>
<p>A few months ago, there was far more noise.</p>
<p>The land in this place is inhospitable. It&rsquo;s hot. Bright. Arid. Lonely. The sun beats down on these people as they walk to their destination. But it seems pointless, the whole of it. Their destination was really their start. All they do is walk. And walk. And walk. Occasionally, they drive. Nothing happens to them. This land is a boring, dry, rocky and hilly version of hell. Nobody knows why they are there. They volunteered to do this, this vigilant patrol of scrubland and sand. Expecting to be heroes, they are little more than armed backpackers.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden, their hike becomes decidedly more interesting.</p>
<p>The symphony starts with a drum beat. Like all music does. It&rsquo;s a simple affair.</p>
<p>Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat</p>
<p>The snare drum idles, then starts again. Behind it, over the hills, a bass drum answers its call, a deep, coarse reply.</p>
<p>Boomf. Bommf. Boomf.</p>
<p>After each thump comes a whistle, the wait as that drum&rsquo;s beat lands. The anticipation is killing them, the targeted audience shaking after each beat. Next comes in the return, the reaction. The harmony to this tune.</p>
<p>Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat goes the other side, as the melody shrinks away to reload.</p>
<p>After a minute or so, the accents start to pile on. Sharp little cracks that pop out in unexpected places, delightful little things that surprise and deliver.</p>
<p>It only took him a little while to feel an accent, right in his heart.</p>
<p>Rewind again. Five years prior.</p>
<p>Life was meaningless here. An empty void of space. But look closely, and a tune develops.</p>
<p>It is ruled by the bell.</p>
<p>A bell to wake. The ringing stays in the air for a short time, the idyllic space between a rest and its notes.</p>
<p>Soft drum beats fall as he goes about his day. A swish, a creak, and the snap of a lock start the actual movement. The intro is over.</p>
<p>Another bell chimes out- harsh and cruel. A million footsteps clatter throughout the enclosed spaces of these tunnels to nowhere. Metal crashes on metal as belongings are saved.</p>
<p>Thumpthumpthumpthump goes the beaters of a thousand percussionists.</p>
<p>Another bell. Just as harsh as the first, but this time cut short by an uninteresting monotone.</p>
<p>It ebbs and flows, stops and starts like a fouled engine. But the tone never changes, a slow melody cut off at its wings.</p>
<p>The bell calls out to its disciples once more, its harsh cry drawing its multitudes to rise before their master.</p>
<p>And they rise, and sit, and move through the same never ending, never changing serenade. They are dying, but no doctor can help.</p>
<p>The boy wonders what he will do with his life.</p>
<p>He dreams of being somewhere else, where these needless rules and schedules no longer exist.</p>
<p>Again, the clock ticks backwards.</p>
<p>Tick. Tick. Tock.</p>
<p>This time, it comes to a rest during his childhood.</p>
<p>The days seem to fly by so quickly here. The notes are jumbled, falling apart just to be heaped back on top of each other.</p>
<p>Crescendos and sudden falls are the norm here, where time and beat hold no meaning. Things happen, and the music rolls on, never stopping for more than a nap.</p>
<p>The day begins with an oddly placed fanfare of trumpets and toast. The day is a jolting mess, but nobody ever needs to look past the next note. Although rough, the music falls into its own rhythm, not needing any input.</p>
<p>At night, things change. The world becomes fanciful, where laws need not apply.</p>
<p>The music changes every heartbeat, going from serenades, to dirges to suspense building overtures all the way back to jolted, not-quite-remembered pop tunes and radio messages.</p>
<p>Then the morning comes, and the night leaves only slight impressions upon the day to come.</p>
<p>The boy wonders what the rest of the world is like.</p>
